# ðŸ©º Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

This project explores **clinical factors**  associated with heart disease using **Python.**
It focuses on patterns in *age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate* across different disease severity levels.


### Objectives
* **Clean** and prepare realistic heart disease data.
* Explore relationships between key clinical variables and heart disease outcomes.
* Perform a **one-way ANOVA** to test for statistical differences between groups.


### Key Findings
* Patients with heart disease tend to be older and have higher cholesterol.
* ANOVA results showed significant differences in age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and max heart rate across severity levels (p < 0.05).


### Tools Used
* Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)
* VS Code
